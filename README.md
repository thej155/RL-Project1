Overview
This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to train an AI agent to play a custom version of the classic Mario game. By using various RL algorithms, the agent learns to navigate levels, avoid obstacles, and achieve objectives, improving over time based on the feedback it receives.
